									<h3>Diana McKenzie</h3>
									<p>I love this app. It's great for finding people to help you with whatever you need. It's very easy to use and has a huge database of people. I have used it many times to find babysitters, tutors and even a nanny. It helps you create an account if you are a new person needing help or if you are an experienced person willing to help others. I highly recommend Help-Connect for anyone needing assistance of any kind!</p>
