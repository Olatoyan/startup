								<h3>Our Mission</h3>
								<p>Help-Connect is a community of people who want to help one another. We believe that when you're able to connect with someone, you can make a difference in their life, and in their world. Our mission is to connect people who need help and give them the resources they need to get it. We believe that by helping others, we can help ourselves. We believe in the power of community, and we know that when you have love and trust in your community, things will work out. We want to help you find like-minded individuals who are looking for a partner or a mentor. The best part is that our website is free!</p>

								<p>We're a community that connects people to help each other no matter what the cause. We've got people in need of shelter, food, and clothing. We've got people who can help them with their needs. We've got people who are willing to give their time and money in support of those causes. And we have a network of businesses who will be happy to offer all sorts of services related to helping those who need it. You don't have to do everything yourself, you can join us!</p>
